## Job Experience

### LINE Corporation
   AI Company Engineering Internship, August. 2022 - January. 2023

- **Analyze LAION-5B and create filtering functions**: I analyzed data from LAION-5B, a dataset of paired images and captions that is now frequently used in the Vision & Language model. This allowed us to investigate data bias and what constitutes appropriate data. Using the results, I created a filtering function and investigated the effectiveness of the filter using an actual generative model. The results showed that data cleansing worked properly and improved the accuracy of the model.

- **Establishment of a large-scale data set maintenance system**: I have built a system that can process the filtering functions created in the above task within a feasible time frame for large data sets collected from the internet. This facilitates the creation of high-quality data sets for training data such as generative models.

### Center for Quantum Information and Quantum Biology 
  Technical Assistant, October. 2021 - April. 2022

- **Amazon Braket Monitoring System**: The existing Amazon Braket cannot automatically delete quantum computation tasks, which often results in unexpected costs. Therefore, I built a system to automatically delete tasks completed within AWS to prevent unexpected costs from being charged.

- **Creating a collaborative development environment**: In the past, each researcher had a di↵erent development environment and resources. It is now easier to create a unified development environment, by creating an environment on AWS and creating a base environment with Singularity and Docker.

### M3, Inc. Tokyo, Japan
  Machine Learning Internship February. 2019 - March. 2019

- **Comparison of models**: Determined which of the two speech models was better in cost and performance by preparing a task and an evaluation method.

- **Annotation of datasets in QA format**: The annotation was accelerated by applying a document classification model to a large amount of unprocessed data and classifying it roughly.


### The University of Tokyo
  Technical Assistant　Technical Assistant, April. 2022 - March. 2023

- Parallelization of quantum computation for higher speed

## Projects

- **Link Prediction in Knowledge Graph (April, 2021 - February, 2022)**: In the Link Prediction task used in search and recommendation systems, I have used a special concatenate method to build a model with deeper layers than conventional models. This method improved the accuracy.
- **Development of an application for separating text and formulae in paper format (April, 2021 - July, 2021)**: Only the mathematical formulae needed to be extracted from the images, and I needed to develop a practical application as soon as possible. To achieve this, I found features specific to mathematical expressions and achieved an accuracy of over 80%. In addition, I achieved an accuracy of over 99% by using a binary classification based on the proportion of colors in the image.
- **Taste Classification Based On Food Images (April, 2019 - June, 2019)**: In a task to estimate the taste of food from its image data alone, I have achieved high prediction accuracy on a small dataset by using preprocessing and data expansion.

## Achievements and Qualification
- **Bronze Medal(86/1170) in Kaggle**: Indoor Location & Navigation -https://www.interviewbit.com/profile/slrparser.
- **Silver Medal(27/237) in SIGNATE**: In this competition, I predicted the success or failure of a crowdfunding project based on information such as the target amount raised and the text of the appeal. I succeeded in improving the prediction accuracy by using ensemble learning with various models.
- **2nd position in a university class competition**: The competition was to classify image data into ten di↵erent classes. As the competition time was limited, I used a simple model that was as quick to learn as possible, and by extending the data, I was able to get a better score than the other students.
- **TOEIC 925**: In 2021
- **TOEFL iBT 78**: In 2021
- **HSK 4(Chinese Proficiency Test)**: In 2020

## Skills
- **Proficient**: Python, Julia, React, Typescript, Data Structures and Algorithms, MySQL, AWS 

- **Comfortable**: Swift, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, C#
